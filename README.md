Write a simple airline ticket reservation program. The program should display a
menu with the following options: reserve a ticket, cancel a reservation, check
whether a ticket is reserved for a particular person, and display the passengers.
The information is maintained on an alphabetized linked list of names. In a
simpler version of the program, assume that tickets are reserved for only one
flight. In a fuller version, place no limit on the number of flights. Create a linked
list of flights with each node including a pointer to a linked list of passengers.
